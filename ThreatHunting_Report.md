# üõ°Ô∏è Threat Hunting Report: PowerShell-Based Port Scan in Azure

## üìå Overview
This report documents an **observed port scanning activity** originating from `10.0.0.154`, executed via **PowerShell**. The investigation leveraged **Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting** to identify the source, analyze behavior, and implement mitigation.

## üîç **Threat Hunting Investigation**

### **Step 1: Identifying Failed Connection Attempts**
- **Query Used:**
  ```kql
  DeviceNetworkEvents
  | where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
  | summarize ConnectionCount = count() by DeviceName, ActionType, LocalIP, RemoteIP
  | order by ConnectionCount desc

Findings:
Host 10.0.0.154 attempted multiple failed connections to other hosts.
The failures followed a sequential pattern, suggesting a port scan.

Step 2: Correlating Process Execution
Query Used:

let IPInQuestion = "10.0.0.154";
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between ((datetime(Feb 24, 2025 10:37:22 AM) - 10m) .. (datetime(Feb 24, 2025 10:37:22 AM) + 10m))
| where DeviceName == "lauren-w-sc2"
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine

Findings:
A suspicious PowerShell script (portscan.ps1) executed under SYSTEM.
Execution time matched the failed connection attempts

Step 3: Investigating the Host
Action Taken: Logged into 10.0.0.154 and inspected portscan.ps1.
Findings:
The script was configured to scan a subnet for open ports.
Executed using SYSTEM privileges, which is not expected behavior.

Step 4: Incident Response
‚úÖ Containment:

Isolated the affected system (10.0.0.154).
Blocked outbound scanning attempts.
‚úÖ Eradication:

Removed portscan.ps1 and checked for persistence.
‚úÖ Recovery:

Reimaged the machine for security assurance.
Applied security patches and reset credentials.
‚úÖ Prevention:

Restricted PowerShell execution:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force

Implemented firewall rules to prevent unauthorized scanning.

üîπ MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
T1046 - Network Service Discovery ‚Üí Port scanning.
T1059.001 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell ‚Üí Executing portscan.ps1.
T1078 - Valid Accounts ‚Üí SYSTEM privileges abuse.
T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer ‚Üí If the script was downloaded externally.

üéØ Key Takeaways
Used Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting to detect port scanning.
Identified a PowerShell script (portscan.ps1) running under SYSTEM.
Mapped findings to MITRE ATT&CK (T1046, T1059.001, T1078).
Isolated and reimaged the affected device to ensure security.
Implemented PowerShell restrictions & firewall rules to prevent future incidents.
